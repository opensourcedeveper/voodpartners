(1,	'Bio Based Chemicals Market',	'Bio_Based_Chemicals_Market.jpg',	'<h1>Bio Based Chemicals Market</h1>\r\n\r\n<h2>Emergence of Green Chemistry</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Bio based chemicals is one of the frequently discussed topics on the earth over the past few years. Adverse impact caused by petroleum based chemicals on environment and resulting climatic changes is the major reason behind it. Generally, the chemicals derived from plant, and other renewable material such as agricultural, marine and forestry are known as bio based chemicals or biochemicals. They are emerging as a valid and environmentally friendly alternative to standard chemicals.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Bio Based Chemicals &ndash; Making a Transition</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Chemicals manufacturers are actively looking for alternative to petroleum based chemicals in order to minimize environmental damage caused by these chemicals. The production of chemicals from biomass, a renewable feedstock, is highly desirable in replacing petrochemicals to make biorefineries more economical and practical. The ideal approach to attain this is to compete with fossil-based refineries through upgradation of biomass in integrated biorefineries. Consequently, biorefineries are adopting various biomass feedstocks and conversion technologies to produce biofuels and bio-based chemicals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bio-based chemicals can help to replace a large portion of industrial chemicals and materials from fossil resources. Some of the biomass-derived chemicals, such as 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF), levulinic acid, furfurals, sugar alcohols, lactic acid, succinic acid, and phenols, are now being considered platform chemicals. The use of these platform chemicals is further seen in the production of array of vital chemicals on industrial scale and the transion from petroleum to bio base chemicals is started hereafter.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Market Potential for Bio Based Chemicals</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>Although, bio-based chemicals have yet to be defined precisely, it is already around $20 billion industry across the globe in 2019, which is driven by just to reduce dependence on conventional petroleum chemicals. It is believed that adoption and production of bio chemicals is sensible approach in attaining environmental as well as economic sustainability. These chemicals have he potential to be more environmentally friendly as they are produced by less polluting processes than in the petrochemicals industry.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>Growing popularity of Bioplastics</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Although there is a strict regulation on use of plastic material including single use plastic, the demand for plastic is growing at significant pace all across the globe. This is the bitter truth about the plastic as there is no economically viable and practical alternative seen for plastic material. Meanwhile, bioplastics (made from renewable source) are seen as a direct substitute to conventional plastics. Bioplastics is an agricultural bio-product meaning that adoption of this plastic is step towards attaining environmental sustainability. They exhibit similar chemical as well as physical properties and are environmentally friendly. Factors that help increase popularity of bioplastics include strict regulation on single use plastics, and environmentally friendly nature, awareness among consumers. As a result, manufacturers have commercially introduced bioplastics in the market over the past few years and are expanding their production capacities at rapid pace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n',	0,	'Bio Based Chemicals Market',	'Bio Based Chemicals Market',	'Bio Based Chemicals Market',	'bio-based-chemicals-market',	'Bio Based Chemicals Market',	0,	0,	0,	'2021-11-23 06:27:26',	'2021-11-25 07:37:18',	0),
(2,	'Battery Recycling',	'Bio_Based_Chemicals_Marke.png',	'<h1>Battery Recycling</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>Battery recycling is referred to as a collection of batteries through various sources, including automotive, industrial, consumer &amp; electronics appliances, and recovery of metals or elements through recycling. Reportedly, most of the metals recovered are goes into second life battery manufacturing applications. Batteries consist of some heavy metals and toxic chemicals such as lead and sulfuric acid. Disposing of them by the same process as regular waste can negatively impact the environment. Hence, the battery recycling process is adopted to decrease the number of batteries being disposed of as municipal solid wastes and to encourage efficient use of the battery.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Minimizing Environmental Impact&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Batteries are composed of metals and other toxic components that cause extreme damage to environmental conditions. Therefore, battery recycling is not only about second life use of metals but is also a necessity. Battery disposal has a potential toxic risk to the aquatic ecosystem, as batteries emit hazardous chemicals. Improper handling and careless battery waste management are resulting in the release of corrosive liquids and dissolved metals that are lethal for plants and animals. As a result, battery recycling is not only a way to eliminate these adverse effects on the environment but also comes with an additional benefit of using recycled metal as their second life applications. Therefore, the high threat of battery disposable is a primary factor in uncovering the potential benefits of battery recycling on environmental conditions. Government across the globe is regulating policies to support battery recycling infrastructure to reduce adverse effect metals and toxic components on the environment, thereby contributing significantly toward attaining sustainability goals.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Transition Towards Electric Vehicles &nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Electric vehicle adoption is growing rapidly to reduce dependence on fuel-based vehicles. This is leading to an increasing percentage of electrification in the automotive sector. Initially, electric vehicles were powered by lead-acid batteries due to their cost-effective nature. However, with an increasing focus on efficiency factor, lead-acid batteries are getting replaced by lithium-ion batteries gradually in electric vehicles. A surge in sales of electric vehicles is fueling the adoption of batteries, which, in turn, is expected to fuel the growth of the market soon. The global electric vehicle sales were 2.1 million units in 2018 from 750 thousand units in 2017. By considering the overall adoption of electric vehicles, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), around 140 million electric vehicles are predicted to be sold in 2030. Batteries that are used in these vehicles are easily accessible for recycling as the government is regulating various policies on collection activities in the automotive sector.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Lithium-ion Battery Recycling &ndash; Emerging Challenge</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The lead-acid battery is the first commercial battery and highly recyclable. On the other hand, lithium-ion batteries are the second-largest batteries sold globally due to their associated benefits and are transforming the energy storage sector. However, they are relatively costlier over other battery types. Considering this, lithium-ion battery manufacturers have focused on reducing battery cost and increasing longevity &amp; charge capacity.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lithium-ion batteries can be recycled, but overall reported recycling of this battery type is only 9% as of 2018. As a result, more than 90% of batteries are landfilled as a part of disposing of, thereby damaging environmental conditions. Therefore, rather than maximizing the recyclability factor, manufacturers chose to lower down overall battery cost to enhance the battery salability. This is not only challenging the overall battery recycling infrastructure but also impacting environmental conditions. Landfilling of 90% of lithium-ion batteries is eliminating the possibility of lithium metal recycling and its second life application.</p>\r\n',	0,	'Battery Recycling',	'Battery Recycling',	'Battery Recycling',	'battery-recycling',	'Battery Recycling',	0,	0,	0,	'2021-11-23 12:05:56',	'2021-11-25 07:36:16',	0),

It is hard, lustrous silver-gray metal found in ores that further used in the preparation of magnetic, wear-resistant, and high-strength alloys. Battery chemicals, super alloy, ceramic &amp; pigments, hard metals, magnets, life science, and binder material are some of the popular applications of cobalt where battery chemicals has gained significant popularity.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>His cost</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Cobalt commercial has witnessed roller costar trend that includes massive ups and down over past five years. This includes 31,000 (2015), 12,000 (2016), 48,000 (2017), 92,000 (2018), 34,000 (2019), and 30,000 (2020) dollars per metric tons respectively. The basic reasons for behind such trend is undersupplied nature of the cobalt market, demand is way greater than current supply, tremendous adoption of lithium-ion batteries in the electric vehicle, and lack of cobalt miners due to its aftereffects. Since Tesla is likely to pump up 500,000 electric vehicles every years creating immense need of lithium-ion batteries, therefore, the cobalt price may see recorded rise in the next 5 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>The cobalt race is turning magical metal into deadliest chemical</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The leaders of the technology have been believed that, the best way to solve environmental crisis is production of efficient batteries. Therefore, world economies are in the race to discover, exploit and commercialize battery materials for this energy-storage revolution. However, relating this to cobalt is leading to a host of other environmental problems, as cobalt-producing countries such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Zambia and Cuba are discovering. Cobalt is essential to human health but to very limited extent and exposure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adverse health effects because of high doses and prolonged exposure are lung disease and heart failure. But while the mines that produce cobalt are blaming for devastated landscapes, water pollution, contaminated crops and a loss of soil fertility in Democratic Republic of the Congo, Zambia and Cuba due to lack of awareness. Most importantly, currently scientists are also investigating a possible link of cobalt to cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>Can cobalt supply meet the demand for electric and electronics batteries?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Transition towards electric vehicles might be good for the environment while attaining the green eco-system, but further growth largely depends on continued availability of critical battery components, notably cobalt. Cell phones and other electronics also depend on the cobalt availability. As per our preliminary analysis, the world is facing cobalt supply crunch in the short run, but shortages could develop down the road if refining and recycling aren&#39;t ramped up or made more efficient.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Dependency on Copper and Nickel Mining</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Cobalt is often recovered as a byproduct from mining copper and nickel. This is means supply and demand of cobalt is highly dependent on the pricing for these other metals. Over 50% of the cobalt demand is met through its recovery from nickel and copper mining. Even the cobalt demand is skyrocketed; the suppliers have to rely on nickel and copper mining alongside being desired to surge greater cobalt production. As per the estimates, the global cobalt supply anticipated to be 320-460 thousand metric tons by 2030, while demand may reach 235-430 thousand metric tons by the similar year.</p>\r\n',	0,	'Cobalt – The High Cost Metal',	'Cobalt – The High Cost Metal',	'Cobalt – The High Cost Metal',	'cobalt-high-cost -metal',	'Cobalt – The High Cost Metal',	0,	0,	0,	'2021-11-23 12:21:33',	'2021-12-11 22:24:16',	0),

It is a type of personal protective equipments that is designed to meet safety against chemicals, debris, and various other hazards. Lab coats used by scientists and ballistic vests worn by law enforcement officials fall into the category of disposable protective clothing.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Role of Government Regulation</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Growth in number of serious injuries and accidents at workplace has increased the concern regarding the safety of workers. The government from all over the globe has made it mandatory to use personal protective equipment for safety of workers. Workers working in different industries require different type of protective clothing, such as chemical resistant, electrical arc resistant, and bullet proof. At each and every workplace, government has set up certain standards for the safety of the workers, which also include the use of personal protective equipment. All the industries have to comply with the set standards. For example, OSHA (Occupational Safety &amp; Health Act) regulations, administered by the Department of Labor have set up various standards for different workplaces. These regulations are creating positive impact on usability disposable protective clothing and it significance at workplace.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Ongoing Research and Development</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>R&amp;D is an investment in technology and future capabilities, which is transformed into new products, processes, and services. In industry and technology sectors, R&amp;D is an important component of innovation and is a key factor in developing new competitive advantages. Furthermore, increase in consumer preference for fabrics that are protective, fashionable, and provide comfort leads to the innovation of new fabrics in the market. Thus, continuous R&amp;D initiatives undertaken in the clothing market are expected to possess positive impact on the disposable protective clothing sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an instance, Toray Industries, an integrated chemical industry group, had recently developed a sterilized type of clothing for use in cleanrooms called Livmoa CL. The Livmoa CL is developed with cooperation from the R&amp;D center for cell therapy at the Foundation for Biomedical Research and Innovation (FBRI) at Kobe. Such R&amp;D initiatives along with product innovation are expected to open new avenues for disposable protective clothing in various end-user industries.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Superior Cost &ndash; Challenge to Overcome</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The high price of disposable protective clothing is one of the major factor manufacturers need to address and look up to. Protective clothing involves high costs of manufacturing due to the use of high-performance fabrics as well as multiple test methods and standards. For example, manufacturing of multipurpose protective clothing requires different materials to be blended with each other, which is an expensive method.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Multipurpose protective clothing is the specialized clothing that provides protection against multiple hazards. Specialized protective clothing also involves high cost of investment during the initial R&amp;D activities. High cost of specialized fabrics such as aramids and expensive method is expected to challenge manufacturers with the cost flexibilities.</p>\r\n',	0,	'Disposable Protective Clothing',	'Disposable Protective Clothing',	'Disposable Protective Clothing',	'disposable-protective-clothing',	'Disposable Protective Clothing',	0,	0,	0,	'2021-11-23 12:24:02',	'2021-12-11 22:21:43',	0),

Furfural provides superior and remarkable properties such as corrosion resistance, thermosetting properties, and physical resistance, which makes it suitable for the production of resins. Furfural as a solvent is used for refining lubricating oils and decolorizing agents.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Future Fuel and Chemical Feedstock</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It is a sister chemical to popular molecule hydroxymethylfurfural or HMF, gaining significant attention as a biobased alternative for the production of everything from antacids and fertilizers to plastics and paints. Strong research and development is already ongoing to convert glucose and fructose into hydroxymethylfurfural as it has an ability to be renewable building block for the synthesis of industrial and household chemicals and plastics. With this, sister chemical of HMF i.e. furfural, started to gain attention of cellulose ethanol producers as well as academic researchers. This is because of its usage as a solvent for lubricating oil and as a fungicide and weed killer and in the production of tetrahydrofuran (important industrial solvent). Furfural along with its sister molecule hydroxymethylfurfural, can serve as a building block for other potential transportation fuels including dimethylfuran and ethyl levulinate. Taking into account all this, researches have been claiming that furfural is an potential future feedstock for fuels and chemicals.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Easy Accessible Raw Material</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The use of pentosans has reached commercial proportion in the production of furfural. According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), the global corn production for 2018 was estimated at 1099.6 million metric tons; whereas, the global rice production for the same was estimated at 495.87 million metric tons. Furfural manufacturing activity is based majorly on pentosans containing residues, obtained from the processing of various agricultural residues such as corn cob, sugarcane bagasse, rice husk, and others. In addition, furfural is manufactured from almost any part of plant such as stalks, leaves, and hulls containing pentosans. Availability of agro products &amp; residues in the developing countries such as India, China, Indonesia, and Malaysia at low cost is expected to fuel the adoption of furfural.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Substitute to Non-Renewable Resources</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Rise in awareness regarding the renewable substitutes has forced manufacturers to increase production of biomass-based chemicals, including furfural, to produce additives, resins, and fuels. This is in line with vision to replace the nonrenewable resources such as petrochemicals. Furfural is a chemical compound produced from the hemicellulose fraction of agriculture residue. It has the unique property to dissolve aromatics and other unsaturated olefins, which makes it suitable in refining of lubricating oils. It is also used to produce foundry resins, adhesives, and wetting agents owing to its low viscosity &amp; high reactivity, outstanding chemical, mechanical, &amp; thermal properties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, supportive regulations concerning the development of bio-based products including furfural from agencies such as Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) of the U.S. and Registration Evaluation Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) of Europe are also expected to have a positive impact on adoption of furfural as a substitute to petrochemicals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n',	0,	'Furfural – Desired Raw Material for Fuels and Chemicals',	'Furfural – Desired Raw Material for Fuels and Chemicals',	'Furfural – Desired Raw Material for Fuels and Chemicals',	'furfural-desired-raw-material-for-fuels-and chemical',	'Furfural – Desired Raw Material for Fuels and Chemicals',	0,	0,	0,	'2021-11-23 12:24:47',	'2021-12-11 22:21:23',	0),
(6,	'Geothermal Energy – Uncovering The Energy Potential',	'pexels-photo-8310812.jpeg',	'<h1>Geothermal Energy &ndash; Uncovering The Energy Potential</h1>\r\n\r\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Geothermal energy is defined as the energy derived from the natural heat of the earth, owing to decay of the natural radioactive isotopes of uranium, thorium, and potassium. Power generated by geothermal energy is called geothermal power. Technologies that used to generate power from geothermal energy include flash steam power stations, dry steam power stations, and binary cycle power stations. This thermal energy is caged in the rock and fluids under earth&rsquo;s crust and can be found from shallow ground to several miles below the surface, and even farther down to the extremely hot molten rock called magma.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Cost of Geothermal Plant - Key Challenge</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Developing new resources requires large initial investments to build infrastructure. These investments increase the cost of final product i.e energy, especially during early years. Initially, the developers need to find publicly acceptable sites with suitable resources and with access to transmission lines. Finding a potential solar site requires several years of monitoring to determine whether it is suitable for generating power. In addition, the workers need to be trained to install, operate, and maintain power plants. Some require operating experiences in certain climatic conditions, before the performance can be optimized. Collectively these factors increase the cost of installing geothermal power plant and produced energy.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Shifting Trend Towards Renewable Energy</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Renewable energy is derived from natural processes such as wind and sunlight. Solar, geothermal, wind, bioenergy, hydropower, and ocean are some of the major sources of renewable energy. Currently, renewable energy is utilized in heating, electricity, cooling, and transport sectors. Renewable energy collectively provides around 7% of the world&rsquo;s energy demands. Renewables are relatively more expensive as compared to fossil fuels. According to the International Energy Agency, the share of renewable energy to meet the global energy demand is predicted to grow in the next five years to reach 12.4% in 2023.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is attributed to the fact that several factors are responsible to drive the usage of renewable energies, the most crucial being rise of global warming due to increase in carbon dioxide (CO2) emission from combustion of fossil fuels. The concern about the reduction of greenhouse gases emissions, increase in search for energy security along with the aversion to traditional nuclear power, and the lack of progression in the application of the nuclear power are expected to drive the generation of geothermal energy over the coming decade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, governments of various developing and developed countries have focused on promoting renewable energy sources to generate electricity, promote less pollution, and achieve low maintenance costs of energy generation. Furthermore, use of renewable energy resources leads to decarbonization of the overall energy system, long-term energy security, and rise in energy access to future consumers, which are expected to fuel adoption of geothermal energy.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Asia&rsquo;s Contribution to Geothermal Energy Sector</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Asia consists of set of economies that have strong impact on nth geothermal energy sector. The list includes Indonesia, Philippines, and Japan. Geothermal power market is strong in Indonesia. In addition, when the 330MW Sarulla geothermal power plant went online in May 2018, it denoted another achievement in Indonesia&#39;s geothermal power sector. The $1.7 billion venture of over 2.1 million Indonesian family units is viewed as the world&#39;s biggest single-contract geothermal power plant in the nation and recorded milestone for a any individual country as of now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Philippines is additionally supporting sustainable power generation through geothermal power plants. In January, the nation&#39;s Department of Energy gave approval for the development and advancement of a geothermal power plant of 100-MW ability to control a large number of family units and organizations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the information demonstrated by the World Bank, Asia-Pacific accounts for about 33.3% of the world&#39;s geothermal introduced limit at 27.53 GW, with further development and advancement expected to be fulfilled in near future. In addition, the presence of few private players is contributing toward the development of this sector. For example, Ormat Technologies is offering heat converters to the geothermal cycle unit of the Sarulla control plant. The requirement for cleaner and progressively sustainable power sources is further increasing the demand for geothermal power in the Asia-Pacific region. Indonesia geothermal limit is expected to increase to over 3GW by 2027, which may uncover profitable growth opportunities to not only Asian markets but to entire globe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n',	0,	'Geothermal Energy – Uncovering The Energy Potential',	'Geothermal Energy – Uncovering The Energy Potential',	'Geothermal Energy – Uncovering The Energy Potential',	'geothermal-energy-uncovering-the-energy-potential',	'Geothermal Energy – Uncovering The Energy Potential',	0,	0,	0,	'2021-11-23 12:45:01',	'2021-11-25 07:30:43',	0);
